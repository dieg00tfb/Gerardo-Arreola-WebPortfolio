                Playing for my high school soccer team was a defining experience in my football journey. Making the 
                team was a proud achievement, and I dedicated myself to improving my skills, tactical awareness, and 
                discipline. Competing in tournaments and league matches strengthened my resilience, teamwork, and adaptability. 
                Under the guidance of experienced coaches and alongside talented teammates, I grew into a more confident 
                player. Representing my school was an honor, fueling my passion for the game and my drive to excel at higher levels.

                Playing for the Hurricanes at Pineville Soccer Association was a crucial step in my development. Over two seasons, 
                I gained valuable experience, improved my technical skills, and built a strong foundation in teamwork and strategy. 
                Competing in matches and training under skilled coaches helped shape me into a disciplined and determined player, preparing 
                me for higher levels of competition.
